26,2,5/14/24 2:40 AM,5/14/24 2:46 AM,1,1,1,,,1,2,,,,,,BNOW is perched near nest scrape and walking around. It is also watching female PRFA
27,2,5/14/24 4:36 AM,5/14/24 6:14 AM,1,1,1,,,,,2,1,,4,3,"BNOW began walking around/perched at scrape to begin with, left briefly (~15 min), then returned to repeat activity--eggs were altered at this time, no evidence of breakage, only moved for certain. Female PRFA arrives late in interaction and drives away BNOW"
28,2,5/14/24 8:00 AM,5/14/24 8:52 AM,1,2,0,,,2,,3,,,,1,"Male PRFA perched intermittantly through timespan--appeared to have ruffled body feathers and raised wings, as if it was doing intimidating behavior. Evidence of prey in talons as well. Unclear if defending scrape and/or strictly eating"
29,2,5/14/24 11:16 AM,5/14/24 11:16 AM,0,4,1,,,2,,,,,,1,BNOW perched near scrape. No evidence before or after of egg interaction
30,2,5/14/24 9:39 PM,5/15/24 5:48 AM,0,4,2,,,2,,,,,3,1,"BNOWs intermittantly walking around and ""defending"" scrape--supported by keeping wings raised and body relatively low. Two observations of food (small rodent/mouse) brought back to nest and eaten. One egg appeared to be shifted at 5:18:37 AM, though not directly captured that BNOW did it"
31,2,5/21/24 5:36 AM,5/21/24 5:36 AM,0,4,2,,,,,,,,1,,BNOW has talons around abandoned egg
32,2,5/21/24 9:46 PM,5/21/24 10:00 PM,0,4,1,,,,,,,,1,,"Egg shifted between photo captures, but BNOW in first picture. Still no evidence of egg breakage, but eggs are certainly no longer viable"
33,2,5/22/24 11:10 PM,5/22/24 11:36 PM,0,4,2,,,,,,,,1,,"BNOWs walking around nest, one has talons around egg, then it appeared shifted in later captures. Still intact?"
